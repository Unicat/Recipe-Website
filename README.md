# Recipe-Website
A-level project

This was my first major project and took almost a year of my time. It's still incredibly buggy but was an incredible learning experience.

I wrote it mostly in javascript, used a premade template for the main pages and tweaked it to my needs.
There's also a back end database with some prototype recipes in it to utilise the filtering I implemented.
I had a blast making this and I'm sure I'll keep revisiting it to see what 1 year, 2 years, 5 years of experience could improve upon it.

How I run it

I use Webstorm for the javascript, Atom for anything HTML or CSS, MySQLWorkbench for the tables and testing SQL statements and finally MAMP to connect them.

If you somehow get it working yourself, begin at: http://localhost:3000/try
